# ansible-awx-kubernetes

This will deploy Ansible's upstream Tower project, AWX, as a distributed deployment in Kubernetes. 

**This is a work in progess. AWX does not support this configuration so there are some errors currently that render this unusable. Read more [here](https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/86)**

## Deploy 

```
git clone https://github.com/rossedman/ansible-awx-kubernetes.git
cd ansible-awx-kubernetes
kubectl apply -f .
```

After this is done deploying it takes awhile to spin up. The best way to tell when its done is by tailing the `awx-task` file and watching for this entry

```
kubectl logs -f awx-web-<some_id>

(InteractiveConsole)
